: Quarterly Report Q1

Downloading Quarterly and Data
The easiest way is to hit the down arrow on the green "Clone or download" and button. Then select Download Zip. This will download both the Quarterly and the data.

Alternately, if you just want to get the Quarterly, click the esolw.pdf link and then click the download button. You can view the individual data files in your browser by selecting the Data folder and clicking on the file you want to see.

NOTE: Please note that the files are tab-seperated values (.tsv) and contain  unicode characters. If you're using MS Excel on Windows, the best way to view the data files after downloading and extracting the zip is to:
1. Open MS Excel
2. Select Open and browse to the location of the desired data file, making sure the file type is All Files (\*.\*)
3. Select the desired file and hit the Open button
4. From the Text Import Wizard
  * Step 1 of 3: Make sure Delimited is selected and hit Next
  * Step 2 of 3: Make sure only Tab is selected then hit Finish
